% Define the column widths and overall poster size
% To set effective sepwid, onecolwid and twocolwid values, first choose how many columns you want and how much separation you want between columns
% In this template, the separation width chosen is 0.024 of the paper width and a 4-column layout
% onecolwid should therefore be (1 - sepwid * (# of columns + 1)) / # of columns 
% e.g. (1 - 0.024 * (4 + 1)) / 4 = 0.22
% Set twocolwid to be (2 * onecolwid) + sepwid = 0.464
% Set threecolwid to be (3 * onecolwid) + 2 * sepwid = 0.708
% The whole poster consists of three major columns, the second of which is split into two columns twice - the [t] option aligns each column's content to the top

\begin{block}{Introduction}

Consider the regression model for $i=1,\dots,n$:
~\\[-21pt]
\begin{align}\label{eq:normalmodel}
  \begin{gathered}
      y_i = \alpha + f(x_i) + \epsilon_i \\
    (\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_n)^\top \sim \N_n(0,\Psi^{-1})
  \end{gathered}
\end{align}
~\\[-7pt]
where $y_i \in \bbR$, $x \in \cX$, $f \in \cF$ and $\alpha\in\bbR$ is an intercept. 
Let $\cF$ be a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with kernel $h_\lambda:\cX \times \cX \to \bbR$. 
The Fisher information for $f$ evaluated at $x$ and $x'$ is
~\\[-22pt]
\begin{align}
  \cI\big(f(x), f(x')\big) = \sum_{k=1}^n \sum_{l=1}^n \Psi_{k,l} h_\lambda(x,x_k) h_\lambda(x',x_l).

\vspace{3pt}
The entropy maximising prior distribution for $f$, subject to identifiability constraints, is

Equivalently, $f(x) = f_0(x) + \sum_{i=1}^n h_\lambda(x,x_i)w_i$, with
~\\[-13pt]
\[
  (w_1, \dots, w_n)^\top \sim \N_n(0,\Psi).

% Categorical responses --------------------------------------------------------
\begin{block}{Categorical Responses}
\vspace{2pt}

When each $y_i \in \{ 1,\dots,m \}$, normality assumptions are violated.
Model instead $y_i = \argmax_k y_{ik}^*\,$, where %for $j=1,\dots,m$,
~\\[-18pt]
\begin{align}\label{eq:iprobit}
  \begin{gathered}
    y_{ij}^* = \alpha_j + f_j(x_i) + \epsilon_{ij} \\    
%    \text{vec}\left( \epsilon_{ij} \right)_{i,j} \sim \N_{nm}\big(0, \Sigma \otimes \Psi^{-1}\big)
    (\epsilon_{i1},\dots,\epsilon_{im})^\top \sim \N_m(0, \Sigma) \\
  \end{gathered}
\end{align}
~\\[-5pt]
with $\Cov(\epsilon_{ij},\epsilon_{kj}) = 0$, for all $i\neq k$, $j=1,\dots,m$.
In other words, $\Psi$ is diagonal in (1) and (2). 
The I-prior is
~\\[-18pt]
\begin{align*}
  \begin{gathered}
    \bff_j = \big(f_j(x_1),\dots,f_j(x_n) \big)^\top \sim \N_n \big(\bff_{0j}, \Sigma^{-1}_{jj}\cdot\cI[f] \big) \\[0.5ex]
    \Cov( \bff_j, \bff_k) = \Sigma^{-1}_{jk} \cdot\cI[f].

Class probabilities $p_{ij}$ are obtained using a \emph{conically truncated $m$-variate normal} density
~\\[-14pt]

\]

where we had defined $\bff(x_i) = \big(f_1(x_i),\dots,f_m(x_i)\big)^\top$.
Now, the marginal, on which the posterior depends,

\[
  p(\by) = \hspace{-9pt} \int \hspace{-4pt} \prod_{i,j} \hspace{-2pt} \Big\{ g_j^{-1}\big(\bff(x_i)\big) \hspace{-5pt} \Big\}^{[y_i = j]} \hspace{-10pt}\cdot\hspace{-3pt} \N_{nm}\big(\bff \;\!|\;\! \bff_{0}, \Sigma \otimes \cI[f]\big) \d \bff ,

Determine the existence of spatial segregation of the different spoligotypes of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) in Cornwall, UK, and whether the spatial distribution had changed over time.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Constant model (constant RKHS)
  \vspace{5pt}
  \[
    p_{ij} = g^{-1}_j\big( \alpha_k \big)_{k=1}^m

\begin{alertblock}{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Simple estimation of various categorical models:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Choice models (with or without IIA);
    \item Random-effects models;
    \item Binary and multiclass classification.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Inference is straightforward (e.g. model com- parison or (transformed) credibility intervals).
  \item Great predictive abilities.
