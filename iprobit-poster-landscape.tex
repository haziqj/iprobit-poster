% In this template, the separation width chosen is 0.024 of the paper width and a 4-column layout

\begin{block}{Introduction}

Consider the following regression model for $i=1,\dots,n$:
~\\[-21pt]
\begin{align}\label{eq:normalmodel}
  \begin{gathered}
      y_i = \alpha + f(x_i) + \epsilon_i \\
    (\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_n)^\top \sim \N_n(0,\Psi^{-1})
  \end{gathered}
\end{align}
~\\[-7pt]
where $y_i \in \bbR$, $x \in \cX$, and $f \in \cF$. Let $\cF$ be a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with kernel $h_\lambda:\cX \times \cX \to \bbR$. The Fisher information for $f$ evaluated at $x$ and $x'$ is
~\\[-22pt]
\begin{align}
  \cI\big(f(x), f(x')\big) = \sum_{k=1}^n \sum_{l=1}^n \Psi_{k,l} h_\lambda(x,x_k) h_\lambda(x',x_l).

\begin{alertblock}{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
%  \item The EM algorithm provides a straightforward and efficient method of estimating I-prior models.
  \item Simple estimation of various categorical models:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Choice models (with or without IIA);
    \item Random-effects models;
    \item Binary and multiclass classification.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Inference is straightforward (e.g. model compari- son or transformed parameter significance).
  \item Often gives better predictions.
\end{itemize}
